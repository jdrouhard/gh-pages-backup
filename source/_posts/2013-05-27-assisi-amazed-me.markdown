I'm on the train going back to Rome now, and I wish I could have spent more time there. The whole town is up in the mountains on a hill, and it's built almost like a maze with all the streets and alleyways. The streets and alleyways are so beautiful though with the stone buildings and facades, wooden doors, and all of the places to shop and eat that are literally holes in the wall. The whole city resonates peace and the atmosphere is indescribable. It would be the most peaceful town to walk around I've ever visited if not for all the streets being on steep hills (which are tiring to walk on after awhile).

It's also the home town of both St. Francis (of Assisi, imagine that), and St. Clare. They are both buried in basilicas within the city and we were able to see both, which I'll get to.

Saturday evening after we arrived, we rolled our luggage up a steep hill to the Benedectine monastery we were staying at. That was our first taste of how hilly all the roads are. After we got there, we settled into our rooms and immediately headed to dinner, where we got to see a bit of the city and I finally got real Italian lasagna. It was absolutely delicious. Gelato afterwards, of course.

The monastery we stayed at had this serene garden that overlooked the valley with tons of different villages and smaller cities with more mountains in the back. Unfortunately when we arrived, it was extremely cold and rainy so we couldn't spend a whole lot of time enjoying everything.

The next day (Sunday) was when we really got to see Assisi. The weather was nice, and we saw the main three things: the two basilicas of Sts. Francis and Clare, and the Hermitage where St. Francis left Assisi to go and pray by himself. We saw St. Clare's Basilica first, which has both her incorrupt body and the original San Damiano cross. The cross was pretty large (maybe 6 feet tall) and absolutely stunning. It's hanging in its own side chapel from the main sanctuary. The basilica itself was pretty simple, but the tomb had some articles from the lives of St. Francis and St. Clare, like their tunics, cords, the stockings and shoes of St. Francis while he had the stigmata, and a couple other things.

From there, we headed to the Basilica of St. Francis. <!--more-->I feel like I'm repeating myself (which I am) when I say that it was beautiful. It is situated at the end of a large cliff where it overlooks the large valley and you can look up into the city of Assisi. Inside is gorgeous as well, frescoes covering the walls but with a simpler, humbler feel. More wood than I've seen in other basilicas. After spending some time in the gift shop off the courtyard behind the main sacnctuary, we headed to his tomb.

It was beautiful. Beautiful in its simplicity and the whole chapel emanated the virtues St. Francis practiced in life. It was simple, not heavily adorned, almost poor but not unkempt. Not lavish or bright, just...enough. We were able to take candles and place them in a basket where the monks would take them, light them, and pray for the intentions of the person who placed the candle. I spent some time sitting and praying there.

They were extraordinarily talented at juggling (together and while standing on other people's heads!), yoyoing, and more. It was pretty cool to randomly run into that.

After we got some gelato, we headed to the Hermitage. This is where St. Francis left to be alone for long periods of time he spent with the Lord. The hike out of Assisi was about 3 miles uphill, but the weather was gorgeous and the view was even better. On the way up, we even heard a donkey that we started calling to which eventually walked all the way up to the little fence by the road. Blayne had an apple that we fed it, and it was pretty random and awesome. Our priest (Fr. Mirco) named it Luigi. Such a Franciscan event: encountering animals on our way to a point of solitude.

Once we arrived, I realized exactly why St. Francis chose this spot to be alone for prayer. I thought Assisi was peaceful, but this place was like basking in soul food. Just walking around was intensely satisfying, peaceful, and lovely. The view was incredible from the side of the mountain into the valley, the trees waved in the wind, the birds chirped their songs, and I could feel the presence of God in nature. We saw the tree that St. Francis preached to the birds from and celebrated mass in a chapel built into the side of the mountain. Everything was simple, humble, and wonderful. Being able to pray and spend time with God among the same trees and dirt St. Francis did hundreds of years ago was both humbling and uplifting and I wish I could have spent a much longer time there.

After we headed back, we got dinner and gelato. At the monastery, Kristy led a discussion about the various aspects of living the married life while we all sat and drank wine.

Today, we packed up, left for Rome. I will miss you Assisi, and hopefully will see you again.
