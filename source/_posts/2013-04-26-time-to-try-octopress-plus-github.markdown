I’ve been meaning to set up a landing page for my domain [jmdtech.org](http://jmdtech.org). I used to have a small little site that explained a bit about me and had a “blog” that I told myself I’d keep updated but rarely did. When the hard drive of the computer I was hosting that blog crashed, I just never found the motivation to rebuild it as I’ve never been the blogging type, preferring to post snippets here and there to Facebook as opposed to paragraphs of things I’ve been working on, thinking about, or doing. I can’t guarantee that will change, but this time around, I’m trying something new.

One of my friends began using Octopress with Github Pages a few months ago as a way to create a landing page for his domain. Since we’re both programmers and hackers at heart, the idea of being able to statically create a blog and a web page using command line tools and our editors of choice for posts and pages (written in markdown) was quite appealing. He went full force on it, but because I’ve never been much of a blogger, I dragged my feet.

Needless to say, I will be taking a trip to Europe next month and decided I wanted to be able to chronicle my experiences in a central location where other people could share in them. I decided it was finally time to set up my Octopress blog with Github Pages. This is the result. Enjoy!
