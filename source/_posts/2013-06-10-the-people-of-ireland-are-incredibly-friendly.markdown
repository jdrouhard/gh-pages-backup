_PICTURE GALLERY_: Alright, I finally got all my pictures uploaded to Flickr. I will go back and add some inline pictures to my posts later, but to see my journey visually, please see my Flickr set [Europe Trip Spring 2013](http://flickr.com/photos/76063948@N04/sets/72157634028687622).

We got to Ireland mid afternoon and made our way towards our hostel. It was the first time I've ever stayed at a hostel and ours ("Generator") seemed like one of those "hip" places for college students and young adults. They had a bar and cafe in the lobby, and the rooms are typically just beds. We paid a bit extra to have our own room and private bathroom, but it was still very barebones. Good thing it was amazingly cheap at 16 Euros a night.

It was also buttressed against the old Jameson distillery. Literally. We could walk outside and to the back of the building to the entrance of Jameson. So naturally the first thing we did when we got settled in was eat lunch and head to Jameson for the tour. Ryan and I were lucky enough to get picked for the whiskey tasting at the end of the tour (which was really cool!) They gave us a bit of Jameson, a bit of Johnny Walker Black, and a bit of Jack Daniel's. Since I'm typically a fan of scotch, I actually liked the Johnny Walker about as much as the Jameson, but both were leaps and bounds better than the vitriol they call "Jack."

The gift shop was awesome. They had various kinds of Jameson, one bottle of which was selling for 400 Euros. That's right. 400. I was tempted to buy a single small glass of it (which was 35 Euros itself) but never did. Crazy.

Anyway, the next day was our day tour to the Cliffs of Moher on the other side of the island. We had to wake up bright and early (5:30 am, which actually was bright considering the sun rose at 5 and set at like 10:30). The bus driver / tour guide was incredible. He was the quintessential Irishman. With a thick Irish accent, he talked to us basically the entire bus trip there and back (total of around 6 hours). He made jokes (there are only two times I like to drink: when I'm thirsty, and when I'm not), told us Irish folk legends and history, taught us Irish ballads, and professed his love to Guinness (multiple times. As well as using an impersonation of Gollum to do so--my precious).

The cliffs themselves were gorgeous. I ended up walking pretty far along the edge by myself out beyond where most people were. It was extremely peaceful and was a good time for prayer. After the cliffs, we took a couple other stops on the way back, including an old Cistercian Monestary that's now a cemetery.

Our day to explore Ireland was our last day in Europe. We began the morning by walking around downtown Dublin looking for cool things. We found the old Dublic Castle, but most of it was closed for tours at the time (which was unfortunate, it looked pretty cool). All 3 of us were pretty wiped out at this point since it was our last day and we had had a long day the previous day, so we took it easy. We meandered around, got lunch (Southern Style Fried Chicken, with lip-licking flavor!), and finally made our way to the Guinness Brewery. It is HUGE. you walk in, and there are 7 levels to their public tour area. In the middle of each level is an open area where the floor is missing (escalators are in this area), but it's all open so you can see each level looking up and down. Turns out that middle "cut out" area is shaped like a Guinness glass.

We learned a lot about how they make Guinness, and even got to pour our own from a tap, which is actually more complicated than your typical beer. You fill most of the glass by pulling forward to let the carbon dioxide and nitrogen mix together as it pours to create the "surge", then fill up the remainder of the glass by pushing back on the tap so no more gas comes out with it. The Guinness I had at the brewery was some of the best beer I've had. It was liquid gold. It got me excited enough to buy a bunch of Guinness stuff from the huge store on the first level.

Afterwards, we just grabbed dinner right by our hostel and took it easy for the remainder of the evening so we could get everything packed and ready for our long journey home the following day.

It was a blast. I'm extremely glad to be back home, but the places I saw, the people I met, and the memories I made are for a lifetime. I hope everyone enjoyed my narration of events during my journey. If you have questions about things I did, want a deeper explanation or my opinion, please leave some comments. Thanks for reading!
