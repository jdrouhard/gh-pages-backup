Well, it's almost here. My first trip to Europe. It's hard to believe I'm leaving on Monday since it seems like just yesterday that I first considered the opportunity when in reality it's already been a few months.

I must say that I'm pretty nervous about it. I've only been outside the US once, and that time I was staying with a family and a close friend I knew well who was from the area and knew how to communicate, get around, and the general culture. This time, I'll be going with a group of people from the states whom I've never met on a pilgrimage to a country none of us are originally from. At least for the first half. The second half of my trip I'll be meeting a couple friends and we'll be seeing more, and neither of them have been to any of these places before, either. How do I know all of my flights and reservations will line up, or that I'll be able to make all of them? What if I forget something? What if I lose something or some of my stuff is stolen?

Regardless, I am super excited! This is going to be an adventure of a lifetime and one that I hope to always remember. I'm glad to be sharing this experience with a couple of my good friends and hope to meet some new good friends along the way.

Here's an outline of what I'll be doing:
