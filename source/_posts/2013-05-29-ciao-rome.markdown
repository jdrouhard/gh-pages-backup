Unfortunately, I started coming down with a bit of a cold so I was feeling a little groggy for some of it. As soon as we got back, we rushed to see St. Paul Outside the Wall [of Rome]. It was the largest cathedral in the world until St. Peter's Basilica itself was built and contains the body of St. Paul. Then we went looking for drugs (vitamin c and cough drops...) and grabbed a quick bite to eat before saying bye to the priest that was with us in Assisi (Fr. Mirco). Some people had another "Vino:30" outside on the porch back at the monastery again but I didn't last through the whole thing since I wasn't feeling too well.

The next morning came bright and early since we had to be at St. Peter's Basilica by 8 for mass down in the crypt underneath the main sanctuary. After mass, a few of us climbed to the top of the Cupola (the highest point of the basilica). There were *so* many steps, my thighs were killing me half way through and my ears literally started popping we climbed so high in altitude. Pictures of the view on facebook.

Then I finally got to see the Sistine Chapel. <!--more-->You have to pay 16 Euro to get into the Vatican Museum and walk around a bunch of other exhibits and various things before you actually get there, and some of the stuff on the way was pretty incredible (like some of Raphael's paintings), but I was extremely excited just to get to the Chapel itself. It was worth every cent it cost to get in there. It was breathtaking in its breadth, detail, mastery, and awe-inducing inspiration. The Last Judgment was a *LOT* bigger than I thought it was, and after looking at the story of God's Creation of the Earth on the Ceiling, my neck was a little sore. That room was a monument to the faith and dedication people can have for God as it must have taken an incredible amount of patience and skill to be able to paint all the stories in that room.

At this point, I was completely dragging due to my cold and not sleeping for very long the night before, but was still able to reflect on the pilgrimage and come up with some take aways and resolutions that I plan to implement.

For some reason, spaghetti sounded really good to me as final dinner in Rome, so we looked around and found a Spaghetteria with tons of varieties of spaghetti. It was my dream come true and I picked out an excellent choice with a glass of wine and some bruschetta. Probably one of the most delicious meals of the trip. Afterwards we revisited the wine store from a few days ago where I bought a couple more bottles, then we got gelato, and finally saw the Trevi Fountain for about 5 minutes and immediately headed back to the monastery for our final sharing time and pilgrimage closing.

This morning, we woke up at 5:15 am to get our things on the bus so we could make it to the airport in plenty of time. I said bye to everyone (which was sad, as I really got to know them all well and consider them all to be friends now), and spent most of the day in airports and planes by myself until I caught up with Tim and Ryan in the Munich airport where we headed off to our hotel, then got some food and beer, and are now sleeping and relaxing until the beginning of our adventure tomorrow.
