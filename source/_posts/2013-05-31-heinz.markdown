Munich is a different place than Rome or Assisi. Maybe it's because I no longer have anyone with me who can speak the native language, or the cultural differences between Italy and Germany, but the three of us have found it pretty hard to do basic things like to go a restaurant to eat. The menus are (mostly) all in German, and since none of their words for food items are even close to their English counterparts, I've ordered random things and hoped for the best on more than one occasion. It hasn't been all bad though, some of the food I got was actually pretty tasty.

The first thing we did was get food at a cafe. All German menu so we ordered random things from the Panini section. Wasn't bad. We wandered around Munich a bit, specifically the Merian Platz area (shops, a couple churches, food, etc). It was pretty chilly and cloudy all day, but we finally made it to our destination--the Deutches Museum which is essentially this 4 story giant museum of all things science and engineering related. We only got through a 1/3 of it before it closed. The basement was all about mining and the whole exhibit actually had stone and rock all around so it felt like you were walking through a mine for it. Each other area was similarly themed; the physics area had tons of experiments set up you could play around with, the electricity area had magnets and wires with electric current and all sorts of fun things with that, etc. It was a blast (and some of the information panels even had English!)

After we explored the museum's gift shop for awhile, we decided it was time to try to find dinner. This is when our first truly German experience began. <!--more--> Our choice for the first night was to hit up the Hofbräuhaus. It was huge, and every single seat in the entire place was filled. It was loud, boisterous, full of clanking glasses and German drinking songs, live band, and had the atmosphere one would expect from a brewhaus. We couldn't find a single seat inside so we finally went out to their back porch even though it was chilly outside and ended up asking a group of four Germans if we could sit at the other end of their table. Luckily, the spoke a little English. This was very lucky, indeed, because we ended up spending the rest of the night with these guys.

That's me! Heinz!" His wife was Anja. Heinz's best friend was a woman named Heike and her fiance/husband (couldn't tell exactly) was Christian. We ordered the brewhaus beer, which ended up coming in this huge beer glass that contained a liter of beer. We overcame the slight language barrier and talked about all sorts of things, especially our language and cultural differences with the Germans. Heinz decided to order another round, so our second liter of beer was on its way.

Heinz spoke the most English. The other three could get their ideas across but took a bit more concentration to understand what they were getting at. Heike was pretty far gone as far as we could tell, because she was a little...friendly to Ryan and me. I guess I should also mention that we hadn't actually eaten anything since lunch because they didnt serve food on the back porch area where we were sitting. The Germans decided to take us to the Hard Rock Cafe next so we could get some food. According to Heinz, Hofbräuhaus was their 4th pub of the day, so Hard Rock made their 5th. It was crazy.

We got food and finally headed home after saying goodbye to our new friends. It was an adventure. A German adventure, and is one of the most memorable things to have happened so far on my European Vacation.

It was incredibly somber, and the weather helped that even further because it was in the 40s and raining all day. It took quite some time to go through the museum portion, since it had such thorough information about the atrocities that happened there 80 years ago. You could *feel* the tragedy in the air while walking around the grounds. It was eye-opening. I'm glad I purchased an umbrella for 8 Euro from the gift shop before heading out, because the rain, wind, and cold was pretty brutal and being soaked would have been very bad.

Once we got back from Dachau, we did a bit of souvenir shopping before successfully finding a place to sit down in the Augistiner Brewhaus Restaurant. Tried some Augistiner Dunkel, and it was indeed one of the best beers I've had (not sure it's the best beer in the world as my roommate Andrew claims, though).

Tomorrow we're trying to decide whether to take a daytrip to Salzburg or to just stay in Munich and finish seeing everything here.
