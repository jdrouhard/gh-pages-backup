Well, it looks like I haven't written anything since that first day we arrived in London. Apologies for that, I had my computer open to do it a few times but either got distracted, tired, or frustrated with the image situation and never really got the motivation to do so.

This will be the last blog post about my Europe trip and will cover everything from our first full day in London through the end, which includes our trip to Ireland.

Our second day in London was full of many activities. Since we bought that London pass card, the three of us had a mission: we wanted to get as much use out of that card as possible, hopefully getting in to places that cost a total more than what we paid for it. We started the morning off by going to Westminster to see the Abbey, Parliament, Big Ben, etc. When we got there, we decided to check out the Abbey first. Turns out it was closed for tourists Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Well. We're in London Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Dang. The outside was cool.

Our London Pass cards didn't get us a tour of the inside of Parliament so we only saw that outside of that as well. The first thing we actually went into was the old Jewel Tower where they used to store important documents of the English government, including the original order by Oliver Cromwell and co. to kill King Charles I. It was a tiny little place and didn't take us long to get through it.

From there, we went to the Churchill War Rooms. This was extremely fascinating. It is the site (underground) where Winston Churchill essentially led World War II. It wasn't 100% safe from bombing raids but was safer than above ground buildings and kept secret, even from civilians. We were able to see all the original meeting rooms, sleeping quarters, kitchen, and the transatlantic telephone room (secret even to the bunker dwellers). There was also a very sophisticated, highly technologically advanced museum about Winston Churchill himself built into one of the wings which was extraordinarily fascinating. Churchill was an ambitions, intelligent, good man.

After the war rooms, we walked around a bit outside, got some lunch at a cart stand, and headed to the London Tower, which is the oldest standing building in London and was the site of the castle, moat, etc. for many years during London's history. It was used for many things--prison, feasts, defense, and more. It was pretty large. The first thing we did was walk along the outside wall and through the towers built into the wall. These were mostly museums about the every day lives and people who dwelt in the castle, as well as some stuff on the prisoners of the time, and a bit of history on the only time the castle was ever penetrated (by a revolting group of peasants, apparently). The current Jewel House is also located inside this structure, which is where all of the regalia used by the monarchy during coronations and their rule are kept when not in use. It has some crowns of past monarchs, many of the other items used during coronation (scepters, orbs, chalices, etc) and always has a Coldstreams Guard on duty out front. Very fascinating and the pieces themselves were quite ornate and beautiful. It still baffles me though how an entire nation still has a monarchy system.

Our London Pass also got us a boat tour down Thames. We decided to see what that was about and took a tour boat from the tower bridge area all the way back to Westminster along the Thames as a tour guide explained all the various things you could see form the river, and a bit of history on the bridges that cross it. He was pretty hysterical and frequently made fun of the various buildings and functions they serve. The modern art building, for instance, he called a joke, and said it was free because of the junk it contained, and listed off some of the "art" it showcased. The specific examples he gave elude me right now but were hilarious. Trust me.

We then made our way to the London eye. Beautiful view the whole ride, and was a fun way to see a lot of the city in a relaxing way.

The next day, went to the Globe Theatre. There is an exhibition and museum in part of it before you see the actual theatre which we didn't spend a whole lot of time in since we got there right as the tour was about to begin. The Globe Theatre that currently stands in London is not the one Shakespeare himself would have written plays for, as two iterations of it had burned down in his lifetime. The one that stands today is a recreation to as close of what they think they original was like as they could get. The fact that it's an outside theatre and the way everything was shaped is very different from the type of theatre you'd see today and was quite interesting.

As soon as we were done with the tour, we actually had tickets to see a Shakespeare play that afternoon: "A Midsummer Night's Dream." It was awesome. Let me tell ya, I never really liked reading Shakespeare in school (I think a lot of it went over my head and I just didn't find it enjoyable), but seeing it as an actual play, especially at the Globe, is a whole different experience. It was funny, engaging, entertaining, and awesome. Lasted nearly 3 hours but I loved it. The actors and the director obviously understood what the play was intended to be like and did a great job bringing it to life.

We decided to try to squeeze as much value out of our London passes as possible, so after the play, we raced around to various things to try to get in before they closed, one of which was the Monument (to the great fire of London) which is a huge obelisk tower thing you can climb to the top. It was a very tight winding staircase on the inside consisting of 311 steps but the view was amazing.

The next day, we got up early to leave for Dublin.
