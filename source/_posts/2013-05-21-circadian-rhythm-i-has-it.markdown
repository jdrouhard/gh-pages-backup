The first day of my trip, which is now to about hour 30 or so, has been a success. Not the flying  part, that was not a success. I told myself I'd avoid jet lag by falling asleep at 8:30 pm local time (3:30 am Rome time) and sleeping till the plane landed at 9:30 am Rome time, giving me 6 hours of sleep and waking up in the morning. Pipe dream, the whole thing. Not only did I not fall asleep right at 8:30, I didn't sleep at all. I also told myself I'd be productive and work on some code for my dominion client/server. Didn't even touch it. I watched a movie, tried to sleep, and read.

Once we got to Rome, we immediately went to our first site, Domine, Quo Vadis (Lord, where are you going?). It's a small little place on the Via Appia where it is said that Peter was fleeing from Nero but saw a vision of our Lord carrying his cross back *into* Rome. On seeing this, he turned around, completely accepting of God's divine plan for him and pursuing with all the gusto and strength he had. The same goes for us. Once we hear God's call, then it is important to fully accept it, embrace it, and follow it with our whole strength.

Afterwards, we roamed (pun intended) around, saw the Coliseum from the outside (and even ate lunch right next to it!) and found the Monostary we'd be staying at. Rooms are sparse but clean.

St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican was next and words can't even begin to describe my emotions on first entering the inside of the massive cathedral. It is simultaenously astronomical and intricately detailed. Every square inch of the incredible architecture is breathtaking. I saw Pope John Paul II's tomb, the remains of John XXIII, and even got to go to Mass at St. Peter's Chair deep inside the Basilica. Every turn has another 20-30 foot mural or large stone sculpture and it was a place filled with the Holy Spirit. The air was literally buzzing.

My jet lag has caused my eyes to burn all day and I've felt like a narcoleptic, afraid I'd just topple over asleep at any moment. I was able to stay awake, though, by never stopping and resting. I just had to go go go. Unfortunately I couldn't do this at Mass and nearly fell asleep a few times (especially since it was in Italian/Latin and I had no idea what they were saying).

Regardless, it was a good first day and I'm excited to see what the next week holds. The people I've met are incredible and God filled in so many ways and I'm excited to get to know each of them even better.

Tomorrow, we have a Papal audience.
