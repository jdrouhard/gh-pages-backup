I have seen the Pope, gotten lost(ish) in Rome, ate Pizza and Gelato multiple times, pushed and squeezed in a mosh-pit-esque crowd at the Vatican, and ate dinner outside an Italian cafe' with an accordion player (exactly like the movies) all in the past two days. Yeah.

My group leader Mike thought we had some pretty special tickets since we got them in advance and reserved them through a local Apostolate, but it turns out that they were just normal passes. The Metro was packed solid so once we arrived to St. Peter's Square, we were already pretty far back and off to the side and I ended up standing in front of one of the giant screens for the whole thing. I think they translated the Pope's teachings and his blessings in about 10 different languages, so the whole thing (including him driving around the crowd) lasted about an hour and a half. Our group was separated during the audience with the expectation we'd meet outside the gate after it was over. I was with one other guy from our group.

After it was over we went outside to wait. And we waited. And waited. <!-- more -->  We couldn't find them in the flood of people exiting the square, so we decided we must have missed them and they had already gone to the food place we had decided upon (Mary's Pizza). Neither of us knew where it was, so we started trying to find locals who spoke enough English to understand what we were trying to ask ("Where is Mary's Pizza?") but either they didn't understand us or they had no idea where it was. We just sorta meandered around for about an hour with no way of being able to contact the other group (no one has cell service), but after some prayer, exploration, and lucky questioning, we found them in Mary's Pizza. We had been waiting for each other in different spots. Justin (the other guy) and I got to see the area around the Vatican and it was pretty cool after it was all said and done.

That afternoon, we got an official tour of St. Peter's Basilica by one of the Seminarians studying in the NAC (Pontifical North American College). While waiting to get back inside St. Peter's Square, it started downpouring rain and the crowd right outside the metal detectors started squeezing closer and closer until I was literally being pushed forward without actually walking or moving my feet. Being in a mosh pit in the rain with a bunch of Italians and tourists was...interesting. Once we got in, the tour was amazing and I was just as awed by the Basilica as I was the day before.

We then went to the Apostles of the Interior Life, an Apostolate that focuses on evangelism and spiritual direction. We celebrated Mass and then ate and visited with the sisters and priests. It was a great time full of good stories, fun, laughter, good food, good company, good everything.

Phew. Sorry for the length but it's been a packed couple of days.

Very amazing architecture and it astounds me that the building is still standing after so many hundreds of years. I also got my first Italian coffee and cappuccino, which were *amazing*! Right around the corner was a church called San Luigi dei Francesi, a beautiful small church containing three Caravaggio paintings depicting the important moments of St. Matthew's life. Then we went to Santa Maria sopra Minerva, a basilica containing the body of St. Catherine of Siena and many small, beautiful chapels. We celebrated Mass in one of them and I am amazed at how many huge, beautiful basilicas there can be in one city. This city continues to blow my mind with each hour.

After lunch (and gelato) at a small cafe, we split into groups and got to meander around Rome as we pleased. The group I went with walked to a couple more churches and towards the Trevi Fountain. We talked quite a bit and bonded more than we could have in our large group on the organized part of the piligrimage. One of the guys wanted to get a tobacco pipe so we went into a pipe store, and I found a wine store that had rooms of wine lining the walls and got a pretty nice Brunello (100% Sangiovese) which was recommended by the store clerk. I also became fascinated with learning some basic Italian, and two of the four of us were fairly fluent so they taught me the basics and I loved it! Italian and Spanish are actually quite similar (different vocabulary but similar words and very similar grammar) so I picked up on it pretty quick!

Dinner was outside at a cafe where about halfway through, an accordion player started playing and I literally felt like I was in an Italian romance movie. It was surreal, and awesome. Back at the Monostary, we joined up with our group and hung out on the back porch, drinking wine and enjoying each other's company. It was a night of merriment and relaxation, something we needed after the busy days we had had.
