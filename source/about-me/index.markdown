The more I learn, the more I learn how little I know.
{% endblockquote %}

I'm a nerd. Straight up. I love learning things that stretch my brain to process things in new ways. The problem (if you could even call it that), is that the more I learn, the less I feel I know. It's a vicious cycle, but one that I inevitably enjoy participating in.

I am a hacker at heart. I love to tinker, I love being on the command line, I love creating new things the computer can do. I have a passion for using Linux and minimalism. To me, programming is like simultaneously solving a problem and creating a work of art. Writing beautiful code is an indescribable feeling.

I tend to go in cycles (similar to [this](http://www.benjaminasmith.com/blog/2013/04/12/continuing-education)) in my every day life. When I'm in my learn/experiment phases, I tend to create new things for the sole purpose of tinkering and learning a new thing. Recently, I've switched to using vim as my editor for everything (which I now swear by), and I've been learning many ins and outs of Python.

When I'm not teaching myself a new language or technology, I will either be reading, watching a tv show, playing video games, playing the piano, listening to music, or coaxing my friends to play board games with me (especially Dominion!). Typically, my interests don't fall into "genre" except that I really like things with deep plots (the kind that really get your brain going). I typically like alternative music and I am extremely passionate about things I really enjoy, so just ask me to elaborate if you're curious.

**TL;DR**: I love learning, Linux, programming, reading, watching tv, music, and socializing with others.
